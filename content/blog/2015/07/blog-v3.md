Well, hello!

I finally managed to launch my website a month ago and now I launch blog!

My blog is going to be absolutely technical one! And as I am PHP developer... Oh, you all know what my posts will be about :)

Nice to see you all here!

P.S. all posts are [on Github](https://github.com/alexsoft/alex.plekhanov.us/tree/master/resources/posts). You can pull-request them to improve my grammar!
